# Data Engineering / Data Science Portfolio

# Hi there! I'm Aya.
![Aya Linkedin pic](https://github.com/AyaBh/Portfolio/blob/main/linkedin_pic.png)

I'm excited to share my growing Data Engineer / Data Scientist portfolio. Within this repository, you'll find a comprehensive collection of projects completed during various data analytics, engineering, and science courses, as well as self-development exercises, each covering essential skills and techniques.

With an Engineering degree in Data Science and Applied Statistics from UC3M's School of Engineering, which holds the most prestigious engineering accreditation in Spain, and an MSc in Artificial Intelligence & Big Data from ESGI, the top-ranked alternance engineering school in France, I bring to the field of data a unique blend of technical expertise and analytical insight. As a candidate seeking the role of Data Engineer / Data Scientist, I am eager to demonstrate my technical, analytical, and logical talents in these fields.

In my portfolio, you'll find a collection of diverse data science and data analysis projects that showcase my skills in extracting valuable insights from data, solving real-world problems, and making data-driven decisions, build efficient data pipelines and optimize data warehouses using a combination of programming expertise and cloud technologies. I also gained expertise  during my work experience in leadership, data management, statistical analysis, and data manipulation â€” all skills that I believe will be valuable in my next professional endeavor. The below parts is where I placed the files and their details.

### [Web Scrapping - Beautiful Soup](https://github.com/lucjankonopka/web_scrapping)

- Brief overview:   Beautiful Soup tool used to extract data from [official Berlin website](https://www.berlin.de/restaurants/stadtteile/), create a dataset with all restaurants in Berlin and then visualize in form of map of restaurants in Tableau Public.
- Technology used: *python, Beautiful Soup, pandas*
- Final results: [*interactive map of restaurants in Berlin*](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lucjan.konopka/viz/RestaurantsinBerlin/RestaurantsinBerlin)

### [Apache Beam - Dataflow Pipeline](https://github.com/lucjankonopka/dataflow_pipeline_bicycles)

- Brief overview:   Apache Beam model was used to extract, transform and load (ETL) data from BigQuery dataset (bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire) with some detailed informations about London bicycles to obtain some insight on London cycling behaviour. 
The task was to get number of rides from one station to another and present the results in form of text file (start_id, end_id, number_of_rides)
