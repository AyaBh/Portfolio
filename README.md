# Data Engineer Portfolio

# Hi there! I'm Aya.
I'm excited to share my growing Data Engineer / Data Scientist portfolio. Within this repository, you'll find a comprehensive collection of projects completed during various data analytics, engineering, and science courses, as well as self-development exercises, each covering essential skills and techniques.

With an Engineering degree in Data Science and Applied Statistics from UC3M's School of Engineering, which holds the most prestigious engineering accreditation in Spain, and an MSc in Artificial Intelligence & Big Data from ESGI, the top-ranked alternance engineering school in France, I bring to the field of data a unique blend of technical expertise and analytical insight. As a candidate seeking the role of Data Engineer / Data Scientist, I am eager to demonstrate my technical, analytical, and logical talents in these fields.

I am now confident in my ability to work with complex data, proficiently build efficient data pipelines, develop expansive data lakes, and optimize data warehouses using a combination of programming expertise and cloud technologies. Additionally, through hands-on work in university laboratories, I gained expertise in leadership, data management, statistical analysis, machine learning, and data manipulation â€” all skills that I believe will be valuable in my next professional endeavor.

### [Web Scrapping - Beautiful Soup](https://github.com/lucjankonopka/web_scrapping)

- Brief overview:   Beautiful Soup tool used to extract data from [official Berlin website](https://www.berlin.de/restaurants/stadtteile/), create a dataset with all restaurants in Berlin and then visualize in form of map of restaurants in Tableau Public.
- Technology used: *python, Beautiful Soup, pandas*

### [Apache Beam - Dataflow Pipeline](https://github.com/lucjankonopka/dataflow_pipeline_bicycles)

- Brief overview:   Apache Beam model was used to extract, transform and load (ETL) data from BigQuery dataset (bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire) with some detailed informations about London bicycles to obtain some insight on London cycling behaviour. 
The task was to get number of rides from one station to another and present the results in form of text file (start_id, end_id, number_of_rides)
- Technology used: *python, Apache Beam, GCP, Google Cloud SDK Shell*
- Final results: [*output text file with results*](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucjankonopka/dataflow_pipeline_bicycles/main/output.txt)
  
### [Apache Spark - Similar Movies Finder](https://github.com/lucjankonopka/spark-movielens)

- Brief overview:   Apache Spark was used to process a large volume of data by using an EMR cluster on AWS. The objective was to analyze 27 million movie ratings for 58,000 movies provided by 280,000 users and find the most similar movies to a selected movie.
- Technology used: *AWS (EMR on EC2, S3), Apache Spark, pyspark, python*
- Final results: [*Top 10 movies similar to "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"*](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucjankonopka/spark-movielens/main/similar_movies.txt)

### [Apache Kafka - Stock Market Simulated](https://github.com/lucjankonopka/kafka_stock_market)

- Brief overview:   In this project, Apache Kafka was used to test the functionality of streaming data transmission.
- Technology used: *AWS (EC2, S3, Crawler, Amazon Athena), python*
- Outcome: Continuously uploaded data to an S3 bucket during the program's execution
